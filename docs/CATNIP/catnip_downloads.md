# Downloading

## Binaries and Source Code

Starting with version 1.8, binary and source files are available for a number of distributions packaged in .tar.gz files. All you have to do is download the appropriate tar file, untar it, and run the binary `calc_J`. They are available on [github under the release tab](https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/QC_Tools/releases).

The files associated with the tutorial have been uploaded to [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCsj_jpMyE0S0cokFJDyBSA0aPNiIHNb/view?usp=sharing) as a zip file. Feel free to download them.

## Developers

To download the source code with build scripts etc:

```
git clone  https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/QC_Tools.git
```

## Note

The project no longer uses git-lfs as it was a source of continual headaches.
